Language used is Python 3.x

Steps to compile:

1) open python command line interface (or Anaconda command prompt) at the location where the python file (name: ML_4H.py), included in this project, is located.

2) Type the following command, make sure to enclose the full paths, activation function name, in double quotes, allowed values for activation function are - "sigmoid", "tanh" and "relu". This program expects 4 parameters:

	python ML_4H.py <Dataset path> <Activation function like sigmoid, tanh or relu> <No. of iterations> <Learning Rate>


Eg: >>> python ML_4H.py "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/car/car.data" "sigmoid" "10000" "0.09"


3) Please give it some time to print error values
